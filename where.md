<!-- # Afternoon Tea


The church service will be followed by tea, coffee and cake. Weather permitting this will take place in Bearsted; we will advise nearer the time as we may move this to the reception venue.

We would be most grateful if some guests who enjoy baking could bring along some cake for this. -->

# The Reception

<!-- Suspendisse vestibulum mollis dolor. Nullam commodo volutpat quam, non mollis ex dignissim vel. Praesent lorem sapien, auctor quis ultricies ac, congue a ante. Quisque metus felis, mollis eu magna eget, ultrices consequat nulla. Phasellus interdum mauris quis elit laoreet, et semper dolor vulputate. -->

After our wedding service we will be hosting a reception at {{site.reception_venue}}. Please make your way here after photos have been taken outside the church.

We will start with an 'afternoon tea', composed of tea, coffee and cake. We would be most grateful if any guests who enjoy baking could bring along some cake for this.

More details will follow, however we expect that as the evening draws on we will have a dinner and a dance.

If people are without cars, please let us know and we'll do our best to find a lift to the hall. Likewise if you have space in your car that you'd be willing to offer, let us know.
